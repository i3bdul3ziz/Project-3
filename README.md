# !WASTE

# About 

!WASTE connects neighbours with each other and with local businesses so surplus food can be shared, not thrown away. This could be spare home-grown vegetables, bread from your baker, or the groceries in your fridge when you go away. For your convenience.
!WASTE is super easy! To make an item available, simply open the app, add a name, photo and when and where the item is available for pick-up.
To access items, simply browse the listings available on the home page, request whatever takes your fancy and arrange a pick-up comment below the item.
Here at !WASTE we believe that small actions can lead to big change.Collectively – one rescued cupcake, carrot or bottle of water at a time – we can build a more sustainable future where our most precious resources are shared, not thrown away. Join today!
